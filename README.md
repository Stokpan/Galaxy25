A detailed, clear, bitmap-only icon theme for LibreOffice. Updated for the LibreOffice 25 branding and to include new icons for commands without existing icons.

Based on the StarOffice Icon Design Guidelines (https://www.openoffice.org/specs/ui_in_general/icons/IconDesignGuide.pdf) and the original Galaxy Icons (http://www.openoffice.org/ui/VisualDesign/OOo_galaxy.html).

To build: zip the contents of images_galaxy as images_galaxy.zip, delete the images_galaxy folder, then zip the entire project and rename to .oxt.
