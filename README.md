A classic bitmap-only icon theme for LibreOffice, updated for the latest LO branding and to include new icons for commands without existing icons. Based on the StarOffice [Icon Design Guidelines](https://www.openoffice.org/specs/ui_in_general/icons/IconDesignGuide.pdf) and the [original Galaxy Icons](http://www.openoffice.org/ui/VisualDesign/OOo_galaxy.html).

I consider bitmap to be an advantage for toolbar icons in an office suite, because the huge number of functions can only be represented by hand-drawn pixels instead of vectors. The original Galaxy however, is using an outdated branding. So I've updated several icons to the latest branding.

This theme also intends to provide icons for functions without their own icons. These appear with text labels when added on the toolbars. For example, when adding Autoformat While Typing, it appears with the label "While Typing" which makes no sense. So I've created an icon that shows a wizard's wand with a symbol of curly quotes which is a standard autoformat feature. Currently only this icon has been added but I plan to add more. I would like to thank Heiko Tietze from the LO Design team for helping me out on this.

To build, run build.bat on Windows 10 or later.
